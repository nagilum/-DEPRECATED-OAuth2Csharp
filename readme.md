# [Obsolete]

This code is rather messy and I've written a more lean version over at https://github.com/nagilum/oauth2-csharp



OAuth2 lib for C#
=================

A lightweight library for OAuth2 authentication.

Requirements
------------

The only file in the given solution that is nessecary is the OAuth2.cs file in the OAuth2Class folder.
The rest is just added as an example of how you can structure the entire thing, either use is as a direct .cs file or as a assembly DLL.

Usage
-----

Put this code on the login page:

```csharp
var clientID = 'your-apps-client-id';
var clientSecret = 'your-apps-client-secret';
var provider = 'provider to use';

// This is the URL the provider will send the user back to after authorization.
// If you set this to null it will be constructed using the URL authority and
// sub-path /login/<provider>/auth
var redirectURL = 'url-for-provider-return';

// If you have the users access-token from a previous login with the same
// provider, you can suply it here and the lib will try to refresh it so the
// user don't have to take the round-trip to the provider. Set this to null
// if you don't have it.
var accessToken = 'stored-access-token-for-user';

var oauth2 = new OAuth2(
  clientID,
  clientSecret,
  provider,
  redirectURL,
  accessToken);

// This will try and refresh the access token if you specified id, if not, the
// user will be forwarded to the providers login-page for authorization and
// the request stops here.
oauth2.Authenticate();

if (oauth2.IsAuthorized) {
  // This code will trigger if the access-token was simply refreshed (and is
  // still valid). So here you can proceed with normal access-granted stuff.
}
```

Put this code on the auth page:

```csharp
var clientID = 'your-apps-client-id';
var clientSecret = 'your-apps-client-secret';
var provider = 'provider to use';

var oauth2 = new OAuth2(
  clientID,
  clientSecret,
  provider,
  redirectURL,
  accessToken);

// Attempt to validate the code-response from the provider and retrieve a valid
// access-token.
oauth2.HandleResponse();

if (oauth2.IsAuthorized) {
  // If the lib received a valid access-token, this code will trigger, and you
  // can go about your business as normal.
}
```

Properties
----------

**AccessToken** (string)

The valid access token issued by the provider.

**AccessTokenExpiration** (DateTime)

Exact date-time when the access token expires.

**TokenType** (string)

Which type of token the provider issued. f.eks: Bearer, so you can use it for
API calls and the like.

**IsAuthorized** (bool)

Indicating whether or not the authentication process was completed and the user
was successfully authorized by the provider, aka the go-signal.

**UserInfo** (class)

Formatted collection of user-information provided by the provider.

**UserInfoSerialized** (string)

Serialized JSON from the provider with user-info which was used to parse
formatted info to the UserInfo class.

**Error**, **ErrorReason**, and **ErrorDescription** (string)

If an error occurred during the auth process, this is where the info about it
will be.

Additional Functions
--------------------

**AddEndpoint**

You can use this function to programatically add additional endpoints for use.
Obviously this has to be done prior to calling the ```Authenticate()``` function.

```csharp
oauth2.AddEndpoint(
  'provider-name',
  'auth-url', // URL for user-redirection to provider auth-page.
  'access-token-url', // URL for access token validation.
  'refresh-token-url', // URL for access token refresh.
  'user-info-url', // URL for user infomation gathering.
  'scope' // Provider-scope, if any.
  );
```
